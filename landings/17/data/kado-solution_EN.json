How? KADO creates on-site model visualization with precise and stable coordinate frames directly linked to the BIM models. Use the power of KADO to drastically increase productivity of the on-site team! Now workers have the tools to see how MEP communications should be built in real world conditions before everything is setup. No more misunderstood blueprints and slow layout of installations with a traditional tape measure!",
